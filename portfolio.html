        <h3>My Journey Begins - 2TVET Challenge Opening at IBTE</h3>
        <p>This photo was taken during the opening ceremony of the 2TVET Entrepreneurship & Innovation Challenge held at IBTE. As a participant representing my team, I felt a mix of nerves and excitement.
          It was the beginning of an unforgettable experience that challenged my creativity, teamwork, and technical skills in real-world problem-solving.</p>

        <p>Here I am, proudly holding my medal and certificate after my team and I were awarded 2nd Runner-Up in the 2TVET Challenge.
           This moment means a lot to me â€” it reflects our hard work, late nights of preparation, and commitment to innovation.
           Being recognized among the top teams was truly an honor.</p>

        <h3>Building Innovation - Arduino Practical with My Team</h3>
        <p>This photo captures a hands-on practical session where my teammates and I worked on an Arduino-based project. 
          It was one of the most engaging parts of the challenge, where we combined coding, electronics, and teamwork to build a functional prototype. 
          Collaborating closely like this sharpened my technical and communication skills.</p>
